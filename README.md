To crunch energy data using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in Python, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Collect and preprocess the energy data**: This involves reading the data from a source (e.g., a CSV file) and cleaning it (e.g., handling missing values).

2. **Calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation**: These are necessary to apply the CLT.

3. **Use the Central Limit Theorem**: The CLT states that the distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution, given a sufficiently large sample size.

Here's an example to illustrate this process:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Collect and preprocess the energy data
# For this example, let's generate some synthetic energy data
np.random.seed(42)
energy_data = np.random.exponential(scale=100, size=1000)  # Example energy data

# Step 2: Calculate sample mean and sample standard deviation
sample_means = []
sample_size = 30  # Choose a sample size

for _ in range(1000):  # Number of samples
    sample = np.random.choice(energy_data, sample_size)
    sample_means.append(np.mean(sample))

# Step 3: Use the Central Limit Theorem
# According to CLT, sample_means should be approximately normally distributed
sample_means = np.array(sample_means)
mean_of_sample_means = np.mean(sample_means)
std_of_sample_means = np.std(sample_means)

# Plot the distribution of sample means
plt.hist(sample_means, bins=30, edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.axvline(mean_of_sample_means, color='r', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)
plt.title('Distribution of Sample Means')
plt.xlabel('Sample Mean')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Print the mean and standard deviation of the sample means
print(f"Mean of sample means: {mean_of_sample_means}")
print(f"Standard deviation of sample means: {std_of_sample_means}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - We generate synthetic energy data using an exponential distribution to simulate real-world energy consumption data.

2. **Sample Mean and Standard Deviation Calculation**:
   - We take multiple samples (with a size of 30) from the energy data.
   - For each sample, we calculate the mean and store it.

3. **Applying the Central Limit Theorem**:
   - According to the CLT, the distribution of these sample means will approximate a normal distribution.
   - We plot the histogram of the sample means to visualize this normal distribution.

### Key Points:

- **Sample Size**: A larger sample size usually provides a better approximation of a normal distribution.
- **Number of Samples**: More samples lead to a more accurate estimation of the mean and standard deviation of the sample means.

This example demonstrates how you can apply the Central Limit Theorem to energy data to understand its distribution better.
