### **Tarot Card Expansion for Standard Playing Card Games**

Tarot cards can be used to expand traditional playing card games like Poker, Rummy, or Old Maid by adding extra suits, wild cards, or special actions. Here's how you can incorporate tarot cards into classic card games.

### **General Adaptation Rules:**

1. **Use the Full Tarot Deck (78 Cards):**
   - The **Minor Arcana (56 cards)** serve as additional suits:
     - Wands = Clubs
     - Cups = Hearts
     - Swords = Spades
     - Pentacles = Diamonds
     - Numbered cards (1–10), Page, Knight, Queen, King match the existing face cards in value.
   - The **Major Arcana (22 cards)** act as wild cards or introduce special powers.

2. **Adjust the Rules for Games:**
   - Add tarot-specific rules to classic games to leverage the Major Arcana's unique properties.
   - Expand the number of players or increase deck size for longer games.
