### Tarot Showdown: A Competitive Card Game

### **Game Title:** *Arcana Clash*

---

### **Players:**
- 2–6 players  
- Ages: 10+  
- Playtime: 20–40 minutes  

---

### **Objective:**  
The goal of the game is to score the most points by forming strong card combinations (sets, runs, or unique combos). Players can sabotage opponents by forcing them to draw cards or breaking their combos. 

The game uses the full tarot deck (78 cards). The suits are treated like a standard deck of cards, while the Major Arcana cards serve as special action or wild cards.

---

### **Setup:**  

1. **Deck:**  
   A tarot deck (78 cards) is divided as follows:
   - **Suits:** Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles (1–10, Page, Knight, Queen, King). Treated like standard card suits.
   - **Major Arcana (22 cards):** Used as special action or wild cards.

2. **Deal:**  
   Each player is dealt 7 cards. Place the remaining deck face-down as a draw pile. Flip the top card over to form the discard pile.

---

### **Gameplay:**  
Players take turns clockwise. On each turn, a player performs the following actions:

1. **Draw:**  
   Draw 1 card from either the draw pile or the discard pile.

2. **Play Cards:**  
   - Lay down valid combinations to score points.  
   - Valid combinations include:
     - **Sets:** 3 or more cards of the same rank (e.g., 7 of Wands, Cups, and Swords).  
     - **Runs:** 3 or more cards in numerical order of the same suit (e.g., 4, 5, 6 of Cups).  
     - **Unique Combos:** Special combinations involving Major Arcana (see below).  

3. **Use Major Arcana Cards (Optional):**  
   Play a Major Arcana card to perform an action or interrupt another player.  

4. **Discard:**  
   End your turn by discarding 1 card to the discard pile.  

---

### **Scoring:**  
- Sets and runs score points based on the face value of the cards (e.g., 5 of Cups = 5 points).  
- Face cards (Page, Knight, Queen, King) score 10 points each.  
- Major Arcana combos score bonus points (see below).  

The first player to reach **100 points** wins, or the game ends when the deck is empty, and the player with the highest score wins.

---

### **Major Arcana Actions:**

- **The Fool:** Skip the next player's turn.  
- **The Magician:** Draw 2 extra cards.  
- **The High Priestess:** Look at another player's hand.  
- **The Lovers:** Swap a card with another player.  
- **The Chariot:** Steal a card from another player's hand.  
- **Death:** Force another player to discard 2 cards.  
- **The Devil:** Cancel an opponent's set or run.  
- **The Tower:** Shuffle everyone's hands and redistribute them.  
- **The World:** Acts as a wild card, completing any set or run.

---

### **Winning Combos:**

1. **Royal Flush (50 points):** All 4 Kings in a single play.  
2. **Arcana Trio (30 points):** Any 3 Major Arcana cards played together.  
3. **Perfect Run (20 points):** A run of 7 cards in the same suit.  

---

### **Example Turn:**

1. **Draw:** The player draws 1 card from the draw pile.  
2. **Play Cards:** They lay down a run of 5–6–7 of Swords (15 points).  
3. **Use Major Arcana:** They play *The Devil* to cancel another player's set of Queens.  
4. **Discard:** They discard the 4 of Cups.  

---

### **Optional Rules for Added Complexity:**
- **Reversed Cards:** If a Major Arcana is drawn upside-down, it has a negative effect on the player who drew it.  
- **Timed Rounds:** Each turn has a 30-second timer to keep the game fast-paced.
